# AD Signature Data Toolkit (Export + Import)

This repo contains two PowerShell scripts that work together to **export** Active Directory (AD) user profile data to CSV and **import** updates back into AD.

The typical use case is maintaining consistent user attributes (name, title, department, phones, address, manager, Exchange custom attributes, etc.) that are commonly used by **email signature solutions** such as **CodeTwo Signatures** (and similar signature management tools).
